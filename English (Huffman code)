Huffman coding :

~ Take the string provided by the user and treat it as an input value
~ Count (not manually) how many times each character are repeated in the string. Maybe using len? but of each      character.  
~ Sort the list from the character with the least frequency to the most frequency
~ Use the dictionary to assign each character to a special binary number. 
~ Create a function so that the program repeats (don't need to write so much stuff). Maybe use a for loop? Is a loop needed? 
~ Make it equal to a variable (output) 
~ Return the output, and I think print something? Then only the encoded string would be printed out?
