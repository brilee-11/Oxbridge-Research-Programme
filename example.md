# Example of Huffman coding

Let's say our `input_string` is:

```python
input_string = "aabbbc"
```

- STEP 1: Compute the frequencies (how many times each character appears in the string) of each character.
    Count how many times each symbol is repeated
    ```
    "a" -> 2
    "b" -> 3
    "c" -> 1
    ```
- STEP 2: Sort the characters from the least frequent to the most frequent:
  ```
  "c" -> 1
  "a" -> 2
  "b" -> 3
  ```

  Goal: we will assign the longest representation to the first element of the list (ie the least frequent), etc
- STEP 3: Start to build the Huffman tree. 
  




```python
for i in range(10):
    pass
```
