# Immerse Education Project

## Goal of the project

The goal is to write a little Python package of file compression, providing two functions: `Huffman_encode(input_file)` and `Huffman_decode(encoded_file)`. 

The user will provide a local text file that they want to compress/uncompress. 
We could even store the compressed files in a SQLite database, in a more advanced version (to get some training with databases). 


## Sorting algorithms

### Bubble Sort

### Merge Sort

### Comparison


## Huffman coding
##### *** Steps on how to do it (in English): ***
1. Take the string provided by the user and treat it as an input value. 
2. Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.
3. Arrange/sort the characters in order of least frequent to the most frequent. 
4. Create a function which has the properties to make a Huffman Tree. 

##### *** Implementation (example) : ***
```python
input_string = "computer science is the study of computers"
dicitonary = {}

for i in string :
  if i in dictionary :
    dictionary[i] += 1
  else :
    dicitonary [i] = 1
print (str(dictionary))

sorted_list = sorted(dictionary)
print(sorted_list)
```
