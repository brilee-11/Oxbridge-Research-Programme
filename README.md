# Immerse Education Project

## Goal of the project

The goal is to write a little Python package of file compression, providing two functions: `Huffman_encode(input_file)` and `Huffman_decode(encoded_file)`. 

The user will provide a local text file that they want to compress/uncompress. 
We could even store the compressed files in a SQLite database, in a more advanced version (to get some training with databases).
